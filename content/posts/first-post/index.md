Welcome to my new website! I've decided to create a personal website using Hugo with the Console theme to share my thoughts and track my open source contributions.

## Why Hugo?

I chose Hugo for several reasons:
- **Fast**: Hugo is incredibly fast at building static sites
- **Simple**: The learning curve is gentle, perfect for getting started quickly
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize and extend
- **Static**: Perfect for GitHub Pages deployment

## What's Next?

I plan to use this website for:
1. **Blog posts** about development, Bitcoin, and other interests
2. **GitHub contributions tracking** to showcase my open source work
3. **Personal projects** and experiments

## Technical Details

This site is built with:
- Hugo v0.146.4+extended
- Console theme for clean, minimal design
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Custom layouts for GitHub contributions

Stay tuned for more posts and updates!
